# 🌸 Flower Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project is a **Deep Learning-based Flower Classification System** that can recognize different types of flowers using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **Keras and TensorFlow**. 
 
It is trained on the **Flowers dataset from Kaggle**, and predicts the correct flower category given an input image.

---

## 📌 Features

- Classifies multiple flower categories (e.g., Daisy, Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, Dandelion).
- Uses **CNN architecture** for image recognition.
- Trained using **Keras with TensorFlow backend**.
- Displays the predicted class label along with the flower image.
- Stores the output image with its predicted name.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / OpenCV**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-recognition.git
cd flower-recognition

2. Install dependencies

pip install tensorflow numpy streamlit

3. Run the notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook and run:

jupyter notebook Flower_recog_Model.ipynb

📊 Results

Achieved high accuracy on flower classification.

Example prediction output:

Predicted: 🌹 Rose

The output image is displayed with the predicted flower name in the terminal.
